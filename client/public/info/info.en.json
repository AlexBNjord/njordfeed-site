NjordFeed is built on the insight that feed analysis is key to sustainable profitability and animal health — but today’s methods are too slow and too inaccessible.\n\nNjordFeed is currently leading a three-year EIP-Agri innovation project aimed at transforming how Swedish farmers analyze and optimize their feed. Together with advisors and test farms, we are developing a portable analysis instrument that makes it possible to quickly and easily measure nutrient and mineral content in forage — directly on the farm, without sending samples to a laboratory. Through real-time data and a cloud-based analysis platform, farmers gain better control over feed variation, can adjust rations more frequently, and avoid unnecessary costs for concentrates and mineral supplements. The project includes development of both hardware and software, practical testing on multiple farms, and preparations for CE marking and commercialization. The result? A user-friendly tool that saves money, strengthens animal health, and reduces agriculture’s climate impact — an important step toward more precise and sustainable farming.\n\nWelcome to get to know us!",

Our journey began when we realized that the current process for feed analysis on farms was not as efficient as it could be. With this insight as our driving force, we set out on a mission to transform today’s analysis practices. With a focus on streamlining processes and an eye for detail, we are committed to creating solutions that make a real difference. Together, we are shaping a future where feed analysis is more intuitive, efficient, and ultimately more meaningful.\n\n The team:\n Martin Stockhaus, CEO. Alexander Back, CTO. Alexander Branzell, back-end developer. Jens Hulteberg, front-end developer. Martin has experience running companies and understands many of the pitfalls that are easy to fall into — and how to avoid them. Alexander has direct experience working in laboratories with high-tech instruments and knows how to produce and present data to customers. Additional expertise that enables NjordFeed AB to carry out the project comes from IT and design developers Alexander and Jens. They will build an innovative and robust system for managing the data stored in our database.\n\n NjordFeed’s vision:\n Daily operations on a dairy farm are complex and demanding, with feed playing a crucial role in both animal health and farm profitability. Our vision is to make feed analysis simpler, faster, and more accessible — directly on the farm. Instead of sending small samples to external laboratories, we want farmers to be able to analyze their feed whenever they need to. With our instrument, you receive reliable, on-site results comparable to established laboratories, but without the waiting times. By giving farmers control over their own data, we aim to reduce uncertainty in decision-making and create a workday where feed management is both more efficient and more transparent.",

      "description": "What we do\nIn this project, NjordFeed, together with Swedish partners, is developing an on-farm analysis instrument that enables fast, accurate, and automated feed analysis in real time. Instead of sending samples to external laboratories and waiting days or weeks, farmers can analyze their feed directly on the farm — with results in just a few minutes.\n\n Why it’s needed\nFeed nutrient content varies significantly, yet today’s analysis methods make it difficult to act on that variation. Decisions about feed rations are often based on outdated or incomplete data, leading to overfeeding, unnecessary costs, and an increased risk of nutrition-related diseases. Our solution gives farmers the ability to make well-informed decisions in real time — benefiting profitability, animal health, and the climate.\n\n What the project will deliver\n We are developing a prototype that combines NIR technology with additional wavelength analysis and connects the instrument to a cloud-based platform where users can visualize results, log events (such as silo changes), and track feed quality over time. The system will be tested and validated in practice on Swedish pilot farms.\n\n Project status\n The project started in spring 2025 and runs until the end of 2027. The goal is to reach TRL 8 — a finished product ready for the market — and pave the way for future industrialization and international scaling.",
